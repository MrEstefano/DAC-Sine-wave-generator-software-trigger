# Sine-wave-generator
Sine wave generator on STM32F100RB in low level assembly code
STM32F10x Medium Density Value Line Devices vector table  for MDK-ARM toolchain.  
The DAC is Software trigger at moment Still working out how to make TIM2 to trigger the DAC, 
I have TSEL bits configured for TIM2, but I suspect I need to alow trigger function in Timer

resources: datasheet, general DAC code, book
